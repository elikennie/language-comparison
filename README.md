# language-comparison
**project idea for a later date :upside_down_face:**  
The purpose of this file is to run different algorithms and comparisons in many different languages. I want to determine which languages are most efficent and which language should be used in certain situations.

## Languages I plan to use:
1. Python
2. Java
3. C
4. C#
5. Javascript 

## Comparisons that I will attempt to implement 
1. Sorting Algorithm
2. Algorithm computing *n* digits of Ï€
